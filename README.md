# failurous-ruby

failurous-ruby is a Ruby client library used for sending fail notifications to
Failurous (see http://github.com/mnylen/failurous).

## Installation

With Bundler, add this to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'failurous-ruby', :git => 'git://github.com/mnylen/failurous-ruby.git'

Other ways: TBD after the gem is released

## Configuration

To start using the client, it must be configured with the address and port of the Failurous
server and the API key for the project it's used in.

This can be achieved by calling `Failurous.configure`:

    require 'failurous'
    
    Failurous.configure do |config|
      config.server_name = "failurous.mycompany.com"
      config.server_port = 443
      config.api_key     = "API KEY for your project"
    end

You can also configure the following obligatory options:

* *use_ssl* - set to _true_ to encrypt notifications using SSL (defaults to _false_)
* *send_timeout* - when Failurous server is slow to respond, this determines how long, in seconds, the notifier should wait before timing out (defaults to _2_)
* *logger* - in case the notifications could not be sent, the logger is used to log the reason (by default, no logger is used)

## Usage

Fail notifications are sent using `Failurous::FailNotifier.notify(notification)`. The notification
can be created using `Failurous::FailNotification` class.

Basic usage example:

    def somemethod
      some
      failing
      code
    rescue => ex
      Failurous::FailNotifier.notify(Failurous::FailNotification.new("#{ex.class} in somemethod", ex).
        add_field(:section, :field_name, "field value", { :use_in_checksum => false, :humanize_field_name => true }))
    end
    
For full syntax for building notifications, see the documentation for `FailNotification`

Shorthands exists for sending notifications of exceptions:

    def somemethod
      some
      failing
      code
    rescue => ex
      Failurous.notify(ex)
      # or Failurous.notify("My custom message", ex)
      # or just Failurous.notify("My message")
    end
